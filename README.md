# C++ Codility Developer Training Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the C++ Codility Developer Training exercises.

Each ```.cpp``` file contains an exercise ```solution()``` together with Catch2 test cases.

My solutions were developed in MS Visual Studio Code and tested with Catch2. The ```solution()``` was then cut and pasted into the Codility platform. The Codility tests were then run to ensure successful compilation and test results, prior to submission for evaluation.

Each exercise ```solution()``` in this repository scored a 100% Codility evaluation.
